# Reliability-Assessment-Code-of-Power-Systems
It was completed by Kai Hou, Puting Tang, and Zeyu Liu.
It can be used to evaluate the reliability of RTS-79 system.
The methods include IISE, SE, MCS, and Lagrange-multipliers-based methods.The LM method is a very efficienct method.
Any questions please contact tjulzy@tju.edu.cn.
Thanks for solver MOSEK.
